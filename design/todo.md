## Implementation TODO

### Core
- [ ] Implement `common` crate with shared utilities
- [ ] Implement business logic to upload a manifest
- [ ] Implement logic to upload the manifest file
- [ ] File folder scanning, snapshot folder, diff a folder
- [ ] Manifest utilities: diff manifest, merge manifest

### Caches
- [ ] Hash cache SQLite backend
- [ ] S3 check cache SQLite backend

### Testing
- [ ] Fuzz testing with weird file paths (unicode, special chars, long paths)
- [ ] Edge cases: merging manifests with time ordering
- [ ] Compatibility with Python manifest file names
- [ ] Roundtrip tests: Python create → Rust read → Python read

### Features
- [ ] S3 object tags for manifests
- [ ] Path mapping utilities
- [ ] Storage profile utilities

### CLI Design
- [ ] Disk capacity validation before download (check available space vs manifest total size)
- [ ] Detailed error guidance messages (status code specific hints for 403, 404, KMS errors)

### Bindings
- [ ] Python bindings (PyO3)
- [ ] WASM bindings

## Skipped Features

Features intentionally not implemented in Rust, with rationale:

### AssetSync Orchestrator Class

**Python Feature:** `AssetSync` class managing full lifecycle (input sync → job → output sync)

**Why Skipped:**
- This is application-level orchestration, not core library functionality
- The individual components (upload, download, manifest operations) are designed
- Orchestration logic is better implemented by the consuming application (worker agent)
- Keeps the Rust library focused on primitives that can be composed

### VFS (Virtual File System) Mode

**Python Feature:** `VFSProcessManager`, `mount_vfs_from_manifests()`

**Why Skipped:**
- VFS is a separate system component (deadline-cloud-worker-agent)
- Requires OS-specific FUSE/similar implementations
- Out of scope for the core attachments library
- Can be implemented as a separate crate if needed

### S3 Check Cache Integrity Verification

**Python Feature:** `verify_hash_cache_integrity()` - sample 30 entries and HEAD each

**Why Skipped:**
- This is an optimization/recovery feature, not core functionality
- The cache already handles staleness via TTL
- Can be added later if cache corruption becomes an issue in practice
- Simpler to just reset cache on first 404 during upload

### Local Manifest Writing with S3 Mapping File

**Python Feature:** `_write_local_manifest()` and `manifest_write_dir` parameter

**Why Skipped:**
- Debugging/tooling feature, not core functionality
- Snapshot mode covers offline use case
- Rust's path handling is more robust for long paths

### Asset Root Remapping (`OutputDownloader.set_root_path`)

**Python Feature:** `OutputDownloader.set_root_path(original_root, new_root)`

**Why Skipped:**
- Convenience feature for CLI/GUI
- Download orchestrator accepts destination root parameter
- Path mapping is a separate concern (see path-mapping.md)

### S3 Key Fallback Without Hash Algorithm Extension

**Python Feature:** Retry download without `.xxh128` suffix if 404

**Why Skipped:**
- Backwards compatibility for very old data
- New implementations should use correct key format

### Progress Tracker Threading Details

**Python Feature:** `ProgressTracker` with `Lock`, chunked reporting, logging intervals

**Why Skipped:**
- CRT handles progress reporting internally
- Rust async model differs from Python threading
- Progress callbacks are defined in storage-design.md

### Download Summary Statistics Extensions

**Python Feature:** `DownloadSummaryStatistics` with `file_counts_by_root_directory`

**Why Skipped:**
- Application-level reporting concern
- Base `TransferStatistics` in storage-design.md is sufficient
- Can be computed by caller from download results

### Snapshot Mode (Local Copy)

**Python Feature:** `_snapshot_assets()`, `snapshot_assets()`

**Why Skipped:**
- Debugging/testing feature
- Can be implemented as CLI wrapper
- Core upload logic is designed

### Hash Cache Entry Structure Differences

**Python Feature:** Uses `(file_path, hash_algorithm)` as key with `last_modified_time` as string

**Why Skipped:**
- Our design uses `(path, size, mtime)` as key which is more robust
- Detects file changes even if mtime is unreliable
- Different but equivalent approach
